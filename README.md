For example, if `ChatHistoryCount = 3` your `last 3 questions + current questions = answer`. After the three questions, your `current question = answer`.

# Ask Question API
The request body includes two parameters: "question" for the question to be asked, and "user_id" for maintaining session uniqueness. Ensure a unique user ID is provided for each session.
### Ask Question

curl -i -XPOST "http://localhost:8000/ask" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "Authorization: df076c44-1018-4888-b3a7-6cd4d821e322" \

  "question": "How can I contact the Calette Reef Club?",
  "user_id": "001"

```

{
  "answer": "You can contact the Calette Reef Club by emailing info@calettereefclub.com or by visiting their entrance at Presidiana touristic harbour in Cefal√π."
}
```
# Clear Session API
It will reset the session for a specific user, removing any previously stored context and erasing the conversation history associated with that particular user ID.

--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
